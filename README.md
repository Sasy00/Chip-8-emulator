# Chip-8-emulator
A chip-8 emulator written in C++ with SDL2
Little side-project for getting into emulators development.

## USAGE
I only builded this on Linux Debian but it should work in other operating systems with a bit of thinkering.
Note that you need libsdl2-dev installed for building the project.
To build just type 'make' on the terminal.
To use type './chip8 "PATH_TO_CHIP8_ROM"'

## TODO:
1. sound
2. keyboard input
